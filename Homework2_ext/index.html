					Aim: Getting connected
				</h3>
				<p>The overall aim of the EfficienSea2 project is to create and implement innovative and smart solutions for efficient, safe and sustainable traffic at sea through improved connectivity for ships.</p>
				<p>Today, information exchange between ships and shore is unstable, costly and marked by old technology and non-standardised solutions. This increases the risk of accidents, inefficiency and administrative burdens. Also, incentives to comply with emission regulations are limited, which adversely impacts the environment. The need for operational solutions in the maritime domain is significant.</p>
				<p>EfficienSea2 develops the essential solutions that are the prerequisites for taking e-Navigation from testbeds to real-life implementation.</p>

					<p>EfficienSea2 is a demonstrator in the Arctic and Baltic Sea and the first generation of a coherent e-Navigation solution. Through global collaboration, use of open source software and an explicit aim for standardised solutions, Efficiensea2 is paving the way for a global roll out of e-Navigation.</p>
